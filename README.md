## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

this time i didn't learn new things, but i took advantage of this challenge to put in practice all my knowledge. i got struggled
several times, but luckily i was able to solve all the problems and complete the challenge. The most remarkable thing was that
i used some grid properties that i wasn't so comfortable using.

```css
.third_sect > div {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
}
```

### Continued development
I want to keep practicing and improving my frontend skills by putting in practice all my knowledge and acquiring new understanding.
